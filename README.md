## Description

THe Business Logic converts a users age for the following planets:

* _Returns user's age on Mercury equal to .24 of Earth years._

* _Returns user's age on Venus equal to .62 of Earth years._

* _Returns user's age on Mars equal to 1.88 of Earth years._

* _Returns user's age on Jupiter equal to 11.86 of Earth years._

* _Then calculates life expectancy and years left on each planet._

* _Or if the user has surpassed their life expectancy, the user will get results showing years lived passed expectancy._
